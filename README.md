Overview
This repository contains the programs written for analyzing syntax, semantics, and memory management in Python, JavaScript, C++, Rust, and Java. The assignment also explores memory allocation and deallocation techniques in each language.

Programs
- Python: `python_program.py`
- JavaScript: `javascript_program.js`
- C++: `cpp_program.cpp`
- Rust: `rust_program.rs`
- Java: `java_program.java`

How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run each file in its respective environment:
   - For Python: `python python_program.py`
   - For JavaScript: `node javascript_program.js`
   - For C++: Compile and run `g++ cpp_program.cpp -o cpp_program && ./cpp_program`
   - For Rust: `cargo run`
   - For Java: `java java_program`

Description
This assignment demonstrates key concepts such as:
- Syntax errors in different programming languages
- Semantics related to type systems, scoping, and closures
- Memory management techniques like manual memory allocation in C++, garbage collection in Java, and ownership and borrowing in Rust
